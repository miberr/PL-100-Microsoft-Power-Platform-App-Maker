# Lab 07.1: Build Power BI dashboards

In this lab, you will build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes data about problems reported by company employees.

## What you will learn

  - How to refine the data model and prepare it for reporting
  - How to create a Power BI visualization 
  - How to embed a Power BI report in Microsoft Teams

## High-level lab steps

We will follow the below steps to design and create the Power BI dashboard:

-   Transform the data to include user-friendly descriptions for the related rows (lookups)
-   Create and publish a report with various visualizations of the information about problem reports
-   User natural language query to build additional visualizations
-   Build mobile view
-   Embed the Company 311 Power BI report to Microsoft Teams

## Prerequisites

* Must have completed Lab 02.1: Data model
* Permissions to install programs on your computer (required for Power BI Desktop installation)

## Things to consider before you begin

-   Who is the target audience of the report?
-   How will the audience consume the report? Typical device? Location?
-   Do you have sufficient data to visualize?
-   What are the possible characteristics you can use to analyze data about the visits?

## Detailed steps
