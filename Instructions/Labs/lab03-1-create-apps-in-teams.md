Lab 03.1: Create apps in Teams
=================================

## Scenario

It is not uncommon for organizations to accumulate unused computer peripherals, power cords and other electronics. Your organization is taking steps to reuse existing devices and computer peripherals before ordering new equipment.

You are asked to create an application where users can post devices they no longer need and browse through what their colleagues posted.

## Requirements

1)	Application must use Dataverse for Teams.

2)	Users should be able to create new items, edit items they created and see items created by other users.

4)  Allow users to reserve an item.

5)  Allow user to mark item for pick up.

6)  If item is reserved, only reserved user should be able to mark item picked up.
