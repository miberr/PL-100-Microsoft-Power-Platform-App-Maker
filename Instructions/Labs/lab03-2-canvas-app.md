### Exercise 1: Create canvas application

In this exercise, you will import a solution with shared components, create a view for the Problem Report table and create a canvas application.

#### Task 1: Import component library solution

In this task, you will import the shared components solution into your environment. This shared component library was built by another team at your company.

1.  Navigate to the [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/) page and make sure you are in the correct environment.

2.  Select **Solutions** and select **Import solution**.

    ![A screenshot with an arrow pointing to the import button](03-2/media/image1.png)

3.  Select **Browse**.

4.  Go to the Lab Resources folder, select the **Shared Components** solution file, and select **Open**.

    > **TIP**
    > 
    > The lab resources can be found here: `D:\Instructions\Labs\03-2\Resources\SharedComponents_1_0_0_4.zip`

5.  Select **Next**.

6.  Select **Import** and wait for the import to complete.

7.  Select **Publish all customizations** and wait for the publishing to complete.

8.  Open the **Shared Components** solution.

9.  The solution should have one item in it. (**Lamna Healthcare Shared Components**)

    > **NOTE**
    >
    > When the app is open in Edit mode, move on to next step, as the Preloader component shows a Loading icon but it is not actually waiting for something to load.

14. After the app opens, select the drop-down &#709; next to the **Save** button and select **Save as**.

15. Change app name to `Lamna Healthcare Shared Components A` and select **Save**.

16. Select the **Submit Report** button and change the **OnSelect** value to the formula below. This formula will create a new Row in the Problem Reports table.

    `SubmitForm('New Report Form') `

17. Select the **New Report Form**.

18. Change the **OnSuccess** value to the formula below. This formula will show a notification after the new Row gets created and clear the form when the record creation is successful.
