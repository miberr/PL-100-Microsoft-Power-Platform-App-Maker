# Lab 05: Power BI

In this lab, you will build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes data about problems reported by company employees.

## What you will learn

  - How to connect to Dataverse 
  - How to refine the data model and prepare it for reporting
  - How to create a Power BI visualization 
  - How to embed a Power BI report in Microsoft Teams

## High-level lab steps

We will follow the below steps to design and create the Power BI dashboard:

-   Connect to tables in Microsoft Dataverse 
-   Transform the data to include user-friendly descriptions for the related Rows (lookups)
-   Create and publish a report with various visualizations of the information about problem reports
-   User natural language query to build additional visualizations
-   Build mobile view
-   Embed the Company 311 Power BI report to Microsoft Teams

## Prerequisites

* Must have completed **Lab 02.1: Data model and model-driven app**
* Permissions to install programs on your computer (required for Power BI Desktop installation)

## Things to consider before you begin

-   Who is the target audience of the report?
-   How will the audience consume the report? Typical device? Location?
-   Do you have sufficient data to visualize?
-   What are the possible characteristics you can use to analyze data about the visits?

## Detailed steps

### Exercise 1: Prepare environment & data  

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will install and configure Power BI Desktop and configure a connection to Microsoft Dataverse. 

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> If you do not have required permissions to install desktop applications or experience difficulties in configuring Power BI Desktop and connecting it to the data, follow **Addendum: Import sample data** and then continue on **Exercise 2** but using Power BI service instead of Power BI Desktop.

#### Task 1: Configure Power BI Desktop

1.  If you do not have Power BI Desktop installed, navigate to [https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore) to download and install Power BI app.

    > **IMPORTANT**
    >
    > If you experience issues installing Power BI Desktop using Microsoft Store, try the standalone installer that can be downloaded from [https://aka.ms/pbiSingleInstaller](https://aka.ms/pbiSingleInstaller).

2.  Open Power BI Desktop and select **Get started**.

3.  Subscribe to the email list or select **Maybe later** and select **Close**.

    **Note:** If you were signed into Power BI Desktop previously, select **File** > **Sign out**. 

4.  Enter your email address and select **Continue**. Sign in if prompted or select **File** > **Sign in** to sign in.

5.  Select **Work or school account** and select **Continue**.

6.  Sign in using your M365 credentials and select **No, sign into this app only**. 


#### Task 2: Prepare Data

1.  Open Power BI Desktop if it is not already open.

2.  Select **Get data** > **Dataverse**.

3.  Select **Sign in**.

    ![A screenshot of the dataverse selected in the power platform window](05/media/image-6-4.png)

4.  The connection details dialog will open up. If you are not signed in, select **Sign in** and follow the prompts to sign in. Select **Connect**. 

5.  Expand environment node. Using `lh_` to filter, select the **lh_building**, **lh_department**, **lh_problemreport** tables and select **Load**. Wait until the load is complete.
